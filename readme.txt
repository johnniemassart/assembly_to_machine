This program converts the assembly instructions from the Module 7 homework into machine code.

Files:
    (1) "content.txt" - assembly instructions
    (2) "assembler_conversion.txt - conversion to machine code
    (3) M7.py - code to execute program

To run the program, open the M7.py file in an IDE (I used VS Code). Make sure the content.txt file is located in the same folder as the M7.py file. Open the M7.py file and run the program. The assembler_conversion.txt file will output in the same folder. I have already provided the assembler_conversion.txt file, but you can delete it and rerun the program, if desired.
